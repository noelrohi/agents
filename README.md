# aigent.directory

A directory of AI agents that can perform tasks without human effort.

## How it works

- Agents are categorized into different categories
- Each agent has a description, tags, and a link to the agent
- Users can search for agents by name, description, or tags
- Users can filter agents by category

## Adding an agent

To add an agent, you can either:

- Open a PR to add the agent to the `src/lib/constants.ts` file
- Open an issue to request adding an agent
